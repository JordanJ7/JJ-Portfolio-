Xquery Exercise 3 

1. It returned 93 items. With each song shown and no tags

xquery version "3.1";
let $disneySongs := collection('/db/disneySongs/')/*
for $d in $disneySongs
for $song in $d//metadata
return $song/title/text()

2. This gave me back 93 items again but it counts the lines in each song. 

xquery version "3.1";
let $disneySongs := collection('/db/disneySongs/')/*
for $d in $disneySongs
for $song in $d//song
return count($song//ln)

3. Again gave me 93 items but gave me numbers that showed but showed me how long the texts are based on the amount of text. 
xquery version "3.1";
let $disneySongs := collection('/db/disneySongs/')/*
for $d in $disneySongs
for $song in $d//song
return string-length(string($song))

4. This gave 93 items again but the ouput has it is descending order.

xquery version "3.1";
let $disneySongs := collection('/db/disneySongs/')/*
for $d in $disneySongs
for $song in $d//song
let $length := string-length(string($song))
order by $length descending
return $length

5. This gave 93 items and returned the line count and string length 

xquery version "3.1";
let $disneySongs := collection('/db/disneySongs/')/*
for $d in $disneySongs
for $song in $d//song
let $title := string($song/metadata/title)
let $lines := count($song//ln)
let $length := string-length(string($song))
order by $length descending
return concat($title, ' - Line count: ', $lines, ' - String length: ', $length)

6. Im having trouble to start this question.
