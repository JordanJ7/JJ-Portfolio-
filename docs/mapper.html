                <p>The Book of Sorrows which released with The Taken King Expansion in 2015 came with a expansion. Since then the Book of Sorrows have not been updated or added to. 
                    I first wanted to analyze some larger sizes of the and started off with size 3. Seeing the "The Needle Ship" really interested me because the main enemy of the 
                    game is the so called "Darkness" and it hasn't been identified what or who it is until just this last year. The Needle Ships have been charged with being called 
                    the true enemy in the darkness and we havee apparently known about for years AND IT IS THE MOST POPULAR PHRASE WITH A 3 N-Gram size. Moving onto the 4th and 5tg N-Grams. 
                    These two sizes of N-grams are combined together because they feature the same phrases such as "blood the oath is" and "blood the oath is made" in between each other. 
                    In the 5th N-gram size the and the 5 most popular type, "in my code Sothona" I believe this is to be made addressing and older name (Sothona) for a recent enemy that was introduced called Savath√ªn this last year.

            <!-\-<figcaption>Here is N-Gram Cluster with a size of three. The words that 
                The intersting terms that I found EXTREMELY INTERSTING were "the needle ship" "code by Sathona" and the "The Osmium king" </figcaption>-\->

        <!-\-<p> The figure below with the Voyant example shows there is a an excessive amount of words that are used. "Aurash" (Oryx or Savathun sister/brother) 
            is referenced 23 times whilst Sathona (or an earlier name for Savathun). Thinking around the phrases and theorizing just abou the words. Oryx has 
            been meantioned the most throuhout the Destiny story the most but again. With the writers that of Destiny they seem to mention antagonists really 
            early in the edevelopment of this game and not use them until later.
