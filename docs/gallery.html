            <p>This Analysis uses Voyant and Ant-Conc is surveying the works of lore books the the video game franchise of Destiny which released in 2014 and Destiny 2 in 2017. 
                The title of these lore entires are "Books of Sorrows" and fortells the journey of an early alien race named "The Hive" Or Krill 
                and detail the history and philosophy of the Hive and their relationship with the Worm Gods and the Deep. </p>
                     
            <p>The Book of Sorrows which released with The Taken King Expansion in 2015 came with a expansion. Since then the Book of Sorrows have not been updated or added to. 
                I first wanted to analyze some larger sizes of the and started off with size 3. Seeing the "The Needle Ship" really interested me because the main enemy of the 
                game is the so called "Darkness" and it hasn't been identified what or who it is until just this last year. The Needle Ships have been charged with being called 
                the true enemy in the darkness and we havee apparently known about for years AND IT IS THE MOST POPULAR PHRASE WITH A 3 N-Gram size. Moving onto the 4th and 5tg N-Grams. 
                These two sizes of N-grams are combined together because they feature the same phrases such as "blood the oath is" and "blood the oath is made" in between each other. 
                In the 5th N-gram size the and the 5 most popular type, "in my code Sothona" I believe this is to be made addressing and older name (Sothona) for a recent enemy that was introduced called Savath√ªn this last year.

        </figure>
        
        <p> The figure below with the Voyant example shows there is a an excessive amount of words that are used. "Aurash" (Oryx or Savathun sister/brother) 
            is referenced 23 times whilst Sathona (or an earlier name for Savathun). Thinking around the phrases and theorizing just abou the words. Oryx has 
            been meantioned the most throuhout the Destiny story the most but again. With the writers that of Destiny they seem to mention antagonists really 
            early in the edevelopment of this game and not use them until later.

                 Mara Sov is the Queen of the Reef, ruler of the Awoken, and former Kell (leader)
                 of the House of Wolves. Born as a human during the late Golden Age, Mara and
                 her family were colonists aboard the Yang Liwei (spacehip) before it was brought into the 
                 pocket dimension known as the Distributary during the Collapse. Mara was the first to 
                 emerge as an Awoken in the new dimension and crafted its society for millions of years 
                 in preparation for returning to the Sol System to help those left behind. She has been a pivotol part in assiting you're character and the
                 last people on Earth. Helping to defeat the Vex at the Black Garden, to helping to defeat Oryx, The Taken King, Riven, The Last Ahamkara, and Savathun, The Witch Queen. 
                 Playing a crucial role in helping us defeat Oryx and Savathun there is gonna be a strong reference to both these names. This being about Mara you can obvioulsy see that the 
                 her name pops up a load of times (72 times). The words "Awoken" and "Guardian" shows up the most also. What interests me most though is the both use of "Savathun" and "Savathun's" are also aamong the most common words awhile the name "Petra" (her right hand assistant) is referenced less. 
                 Looking at the N-Gram Tokens in Antconc with a size of 2 it amases to 2414 Tokens.

            The most troublesome tasks to do inside HTML and GitHub are pretty obvious, with learning the coding language. The basic commands inside GitHub were not that hard to execute, but the hard problem was troubleshooting the pushing from GitBash onto GitHub and the Internet. Outside GitBash. GitHub was fairly easy to understand its user interface and actions throughout the process of creating a website.
            With HTML and CSS inside the Oxygen code editor, it was tough for me at the start trying to learn another coding language on top of the command line/GitBash but I came accustomed to it. I enjoy using HTML and CSS to do website development. Using Oxygen to develop my website came with way more ways to accessorize my website and gave me so much freedom to do whatever I want on my website.
            Using HTML and CSS or organizing layouts is way harder than using the PSU site's page. With using the site's page you simply drag and drop or use a similar technique to use photos, videos, or anything. Using HTML and CSS you have to code into two separate sheets and use a completely different language with CSS and HTML. 
            To develop using HTML and CSS you have to have great troubleshooting skills, memory with tags, and be very patient with programming and the software. Using the Sites page is very familiar in a way with other software like Adobe suite or Microsoft Suite. You just have to get used to it and get around the restrictions with the templates and somewhat outdated user interface. I want to learn more CSS and make my website have moving parts such as the Apple website as in, when you move down a page it morphs into a different photo or video. I also want to learn the attributes or tags of both HTML and CSS to develop a more clean code inside Oxygen.
