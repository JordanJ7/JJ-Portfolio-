                  This starting week I got introduced to the staff all acorss each job site. This includes Erie Bayfront Convention Center, Erie Insurance Arena, UPMC Ball Park,
                  I have also been specially introduced to people that I can collab with such the Convention Centers (main office for me) website manager and social media team. 
                  I also have been introduced to the Warners Bros. Theater production manager and have noted that I would like to collab with him.  
                  Warner Theater, and the Sheraton Hotel. <br> <br/> After the first two introduction days I have been doing multiple projects across a few sites. 
                  One major project that me and my site manager (Michael Bane) need to do is set up around a total of 50 camera systems throughout The Sheraton Hotel and bayfront Coonvetion Center. 
                  Wednesday and Thursday Michael and I went over the the Sheraton and hooked the few existing cameras up. We just had an new switch box installed in the Sheraton to 
                  accompany all the new cameras, which we then hooked up. On my off time from doing main projects I have revived this dead website lol. I replaced most pages and 
                  combined all my school work onto the class projects site on my  nav bar and made the pages more uniform and stylized.

          <h4 class="center5">Week of May 20th </h4>
          
          <ul> <li> This 2nd week I goit introduced to more people over at the Sheraton Hotel. Throughout the week we hung around 20 cameras throughout the kitchen and lobby and garage. 
              My main task I wanted to do this week was to redo my color scheme on my website. I have been on a Dune spree reading the first book and wacthing the second movie that came out. 
              I have been kinda obsessed  lol. I redid the color scheme to match color of spice from the movie which is a dark brown with an accent around the edge of the webpage. 
              I also found the font that they used on the movie trailer, which I am obsessed with! Overall I am happy with the upgrades aand can't wait top see what else I can and will add. 
              To lastly note I have a meeting on the 29th with our social media/ website manager and I can't wait to share some ideas. Some questions I wanted to ask were, If there was any engagment across a younger audience with things such as anime expo, opr pokemon tournaments etc.

          <h4 class="center5">Week of May 27th </h4>
          
          <ul> <li> This 2rd week interning at ECCCA I personally did not do much project wise across the Sheraton Hotel. 
             We had monday off due to Memorial Day. On Teusday we hung a few cameras and I worked heavily on my website and included a page 
             showcasing every important class, qualification or certificate that I recieved or completed. This will help future employers or agencies to see what I have done in more detail outside of my resume. On wednesday I had a meeting with the 
             Erie events social media and website manager Erica. We disscussed loads of things but the main takeaways she wanted me to do was to a full website audit of the Erie Events homepages that include the convention center, the theater, 
             and the Erie Insurance Arena. She also wanted me to record and take reels showing of each area and put them on the websites. The major problem she was having was the website editor and service provider she was using was not 
             allowing much customization for the web pages, so she needs to contact them and get that sorted out. The rest of the week I could not work due to a hacking attempt from an unknown person that brought the internet down halted our offices from doing anything.
             Michael was busy with that through the rest of the week and we will see come monday if the problem has been resolved.
