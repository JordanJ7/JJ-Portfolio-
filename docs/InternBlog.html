          This starting week I got introduced to the staff all acorss each job site. This includes Erie Bayfront Convention Center, Erie Insurance Arena, UPMC Ball Park,
          I haave also been specially introduced to people that I can collab with such the Convention Centers (main office for me) website manager and social media team. 
          I also have been introduced to the Warners Bros. Theater production manager and have noted that I would like to collab with him.  
          Warner Theater, and the Sheraton Hotel. After the first two introduction days I have been doing multiple projects across a few sites. 
          One major project that me and my site manager (Michael Bane) need to do is set up around a total of 50 camera systems throughout The Sheraton Hotel. 
          Wednesday and Thursday Michael and I went over the the Sheraton and hooked the few existing cameras up. We just had an new switch box installed in the Sheraton to 
          accompany all the new cameras, which we then hooked up. On my off time from doing main projects I have revived this dead website LoL. I replaced most pages and 
          combined all my school work onto the class projects site on my  nav bar and made the pages more uniform and stylized.
