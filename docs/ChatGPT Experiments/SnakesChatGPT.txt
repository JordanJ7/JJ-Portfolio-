Snakes on a Plane Poem but in style of Edgar Allen Poe Trial One 

Once upon a time, on a plane in flight,
A serpent slithered, causing much fright,
It hissed and coiled, with venomous fangs,
As the passengers panicked and wrangled their tangs.

The serpent was sly, with a sly twist of tongue,
It slithered and coiled, its sinews wrung,
Its beady eyes gleamed with a wicked delight,
As it prepared to strike in the dead of night.

The passengers screamed and cried in despair,
As the venomous snake slithered here and there,
But the brave pilot, with nerves of steel,
Flies the plane with skill and an iron will.

And so the plane landed, safe and sound,
The passengers cheering all around,
The serpent was captured, and all was well,
Thanks to the bravery of those who could tell.

But the memory lingers, of that fateful flight,
When a serpent slithered, causing such a fright,
So let this be a lesson, to all who may roam,
Beware of snakes on a plane, lest you meet your doom.

Trial Two

Snakes on a plane, a terror untold,
Coiled and ready, their venom to unfold.
Their hissing fills the cabin with dread,
As they slither and crawl upon the overhead.

Passengers scream and try to flee,
But the snakes block the exit, they're stuck, can't you see?
The captain tries to land, but it's too late,
The snakes have taken control, it's a fateful fate.

The plane dips and turns, a rollercoaster ride,
As the snakes strike out, venomous and sly.
In the chaos and panic, no one can think,
How did these snakes get on board, what do they want, what do they seek?

As the plane plummets towards the earth below,
The snakes triumph, their plan a success, don't you know.
But as the wreckage burns and smoke fills the air,
One can't help but wonder, was it all just a nightmare?


Trial Three

Snakes on a plane, a terror unseen
Slithering and creeping, a fearful scene
Their venomous fangs, a deadly threat
No escape from their serpentine net

The passengers scream, a chorus of fright
As the snakes writhe and twist in flight
The captain struggles to keep control
But the snakes are too numerous, taking a toll

Panic ensues, the chaos uncontrolled
As the snakes slither, their mission unfolds
No mercy shown, their prey in their grasp
The plane descends, a final, fateful gasp

But wait! A hero rises, brave and true
He fights the snakes, their fate now overdue
With courage and strength, he saves the day
The snakes vanquished, the passengers safe

Snakes on a plane, a story now told
Of terror and triumph, a tale of old
But the memory remains, a fear instilled
Of snakes on a plane, a nightmare fulfilled



Create a poem in the style of Edgar Allen Poe that is about snakes on a plane then jump into a boat then die from drowning Trial One 

Snakes on a plane, so deadly and sly
Slithering and writhing, causing much dismay
But little did they know, their fate was to die
In a boat, on the water, far from the sky

The engine roared as they took to the waves
The snakes hissed and slithered, their fangs bared
But the boat was too small, their fate it betrayed
As the waves crashed and the boat was swayed

The snakes writhed and twisted, trying to escape
But the boat was tilting, their fate was sealed
Down into the water, they did all take
Drowning in the depths, their lives were peeled

So ends the tale of the snakes on a plane
Their journey cut short, by drowning in the rain
Their demise was swift, in a boat on the main
Leaving behind only memories and pain


Trial Two 

Snakes on a plane, slithering and sly
In the cabin they twist, with no way to fly
The passengers scream, with fear in their hearts
But the snakes, they just hiss, with venomous darts

On and on they crawl, through the aisle and the seats
No one knows what they want, or where they'll retreat
But suddenly, the plane starts to shake
And the snakes, they all fall, into the lake

In a panic, the passengers jump, into a boat nearby
But the water is rough, and the wind starts to high
As they try to escape, the boat starts to sway
And in the icy depths, they all drown that day

The snakes, they were vicious, with venom in their bites
But in the end, it was the water, that ended the fights
The moral of the story, a warning to all
Beware of snakes on a plane, or you'll meet a watery fall


Trial Three 

Snakes on a plane, slithering and sly
Their venomous fangs ready to strike
Panicked passengers scream and cry
As the serpent's coils wrap tight

But oh, what a twist in the tale
As the plane starts to plunge
Into the ocean's cold, dark depths
There is no time to take a lunge

The snakes escape from their cages
But their freedom is short-lived
As the plane sinks to the bottom
They are doomed, and so are the rest

In the chaos of the sinking vessel
Some manage to jump into a boat
But even that small hope is shattered
As the waves begin to float

The snakes writhe and twist
In their final moments of life
As the boat capsizes and sinks
Into the depths of the ocean rife

And so the tale ends, a tragic one
Of snakes and humans doomed to drown
Their fates sealed by a deadly fate
As the ocean claims them, never to be found
