            The most troublesome tasks to do inside HTML and GitHub are pretty obvious, with learning the coding language. The basic commands inside GitHub were not that hard to execute, but the hard problem was troubleshooting the pushing from GitBash onto GitHub and the Internet. Outside GitBash. GitHub was fairly easy to understand its user interface and actions throughout the process of creating a website.
            With HTML and CSS inside the Oxygen code editor, it was tough for me at the start trying to learn another coding language on top of the command line/GitBash but I came accustomed to it. I enjoy using HTML and CSS to do website development. Using Oxygen to develop my website came with way more ways to accessorize my website and gave me so much freedom to do whatever I want on my website.
            Using HTML and CSS or organizing layouts is way harder than using the PSU site's page. With using the site's page you simply drag and drop or use a similar technique to use photos, videos, or anything. Using HTML and CSS you have to code into two separate sheets and use a completely different language with CSS and HTML. 
            To develop using HTML and CSS you have to have great troubleshooting skills, memory with tags, and be very patient with programming and the software. Using the Sites page is very familiar in a way with other software like Adobe suite or Microsoft Suite. You just have to get used to it and get around the restrictions with the templates and somewhat outdated user interface. I want to learn more CSS and make my website have moving parts such as the Apple website as in, when you move down a page it morphs into a different photo or video. I also want to learn the attributes or tags of both HTML and CSS to develop a more clean code inside Oxygen.
