        <h3  class="center3 square">I was born in Philadelphia on July 11, 2003. I lived in between New Jersey and Philly all the way through till before 9th grade started and 
          then moved to Erie, PA where I finished high school.  I am currently attending Penn State Behrend for DIGIT or <dfn>(Digital Media, 
          Arts and Technology)</dfn> and an minor in Game Development. <br> <br/>
          I aspire to be an amazing game developer and want to work at studios such as <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en" > Riot Games </a> 
          or <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en" > Bungie Inc. </a>  I want to specilize in enviorement design, storyboarding, gameplay design, and weapon designer. To help achieve that goal I will be doing art and design classes durinbg this final school year and also taking certificates in C++ 
          and C# throughout the summer and fall to help soldify my programming and artistic skills. My all time favorite game franchise is Destiny <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/destiny" >  </a> created by Bungie Inc.
