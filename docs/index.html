        <p>Welcome to my <a href="sample.html">sample Website!</a></p>
      <!-- GOT EMM :) -->
      
      
        <p>Here is a sample link to another website outside of this site. This link holds an
                <dfn>absolute URL</dfn>
            <a href="https://coolmathgames.com/">The best thing to do in the middle of DIGIT 100 class</a>. Here is another link for an <dfn>absolute INSANE URL</dfn> that 
            takes you to <a href="https://youtu.be/h4VJGNNSQnw"> This song that I found was fantastic and the show was amazing</a>.</p>
          <!--This ^ was a joke I actually pay attention inside this class. -->

        <p>We are writing HTML in the XHTML syntax, which means that all elements (including
            self-closing elements like <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) must indicate how they close. All
            elements in XHTML syntax must have a start tag and an end tag, or indicate that they are
            self-closing. </p>

            <h3>A <strong>third-level</strong> heading just to see what that looks like</h3>
            <p>HTML code has no use instead of ur mom <em>lower-level</em> headings like from h2 to h6, but use them in order
                as you create subsections! You can control the size, position, color, font, and more
                of headings (and any HTML display elements) using CSS.</p>
            <p>When should I use <b>bold</b> vs. <strong>strong</strong> in HTML code? These are
                    <dfn>inline</dfn> elements.</p>
            <p> Other HTML elements like the <dfn>p</dfn> (for paragraph) or the heading level
                elements, or ordered and unorderd lists, or img elements make blocks on the page and
                are known as <dfn>block</dfn> elements.</p>

            <p>Images can be tricky to format. First let's just include them on the website. In your code, you point to an image file in your file directory
                to make it appear on the page when it is published.</p>
            <p>The <code>img</code> element is the basic code for including an image file on your page. The <code>@src</code> attribute points to a filepath
                to your image. The <code>@alt</code> attribute provides a text description for screen readers, helping your images to be accessible to non-sighted readers
                and also to assist with search retrievals (say, google searches) by providing some context of what's in the image. 
                Writing code on a site to assist with search retrieval is called <dfn>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</dfn>.
            </p>
            
            <p>I am starting my journey into website and GitHub development. <code>figure</code> element is intended to help organize images and captions in a 
            little nested structure, that makes it convenient to style for proportion on the page. I am also adding a <code>class</code> attribute to help
            me with styling different kinds of images (photos vs. small icons on my site). I write <a href="style.css">CSS code</a> to find elements with a <code>class="photo"</code>
            and style them all the same way, and I put that code in a separate file so it can handle styling the same way across all the pages on my
            website. I link that CSS stylesheet to my HTML files up in the <code>head</code> element. <em>Can you find the CSS <code>link</code> line in this file?</em></p>
