        <h2>Introducing Jordan M. James</h2>
        <p>I was born in Philladelphia on July 11, 2003. I lived in between New Jersey and Philly all the way through till before 9th grade started and 
          then moved to Erie,PA where I finished high school and currently and Penn State Behrend for DIGITS or <dfn>Digital Media, Arts and Technology</dfn>  
        </p>
        
        <p>I am starting my journey into website and GitHub development with this website. I will be working on this website all throughout my time in the DIGITS program.
          I am styling different kinds of images (photos vs. small icons on my site). I write <a href="style.css">CSS code</a> and style each page the all the same way, and I put that code 
          in a separate file so it can handle styling the same way across all the pages og my
          website.
