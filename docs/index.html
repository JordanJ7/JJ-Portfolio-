            <h2>Introducing Jordan M. James</h2>
            <p>I was born in Philladelphia on July 11, 2003. I lived in between New Jersey and Philly all the way through till before 9th grade started and 
                then moved to Erie,PA where I finished high school and currently and Penn State Behrend for DIGITS or <dfn>Digital Media, Arts and Technology</dfn>  
            </p>
            
             <p>I am starting my journey into website and GitHub development with this website. I will be working on this website all throughout my time in the DIGITS program.
               I am styling different kinds of images (photos vs. small icons on my site). I write <a href="style.css">CSS code</a> and style each page the all the same way, and I put that code in a separate file so it can handle styling the same way across all the pages on my
                website.
