            <li style="text-align: center;">This portfolio features all my play logs and Twine game that I created across my foruth semester at Penn State Behrend College in my GAME 220 class with Dr. Josh Hussey. 
                You can check out my play logs and Twine web game below. Just entering the DIGIT program at Behrend I did not have much experience in Twine, game design or even web developing, 
                but I had a passion for technology and creative mind to pair with it. I find that design websites and using the Twine software was alot of fun, 
                especually organizing certain things that really itched that part of my brain. Even with my Twine game below I organized the passages in the software to resemble Chess piece move sets. 
                Currently in my sephmore year I don't have a current style to be known for. Ever since I was young I loved technology I loved ripping apart computers, I loved video games espcially. 
                In my early teens I bought a video game called Destiny for my Xbox 360. I was entranced by the narrative of light and dark, the envoirments. Everything about the game I loved. 
                This got me into everyting game related in my future. I want to present my on things to the world but I struggle with my identity and what I want to show to the world. 
                I feel as if the college expereince leans in the right direction but does not let us as individuals give more attention to a specific project or vision. 
                I'd want quality over quantity so we can put our full effort towards making the best of something that we  feel would be our best work and not have to do dozens of mediocore projects that are half done. 
                I work hard to try and make a mark somewhere or with someone that is my goal. My aestetic is not amazing or out of this world, 
                there is no rythem to my work, but there is a story. My Story.
