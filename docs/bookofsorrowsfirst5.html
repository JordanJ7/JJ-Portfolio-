    Calcified Fragments: Curiosity
    
    Dearest sisters,
    
    It’s taken me two years — a quarter of our lives — but I’ve found the proof. We aren’t native to the Fundament. Our ancient ancestors came here to hide.
    
    The plate of stone we live on, our Osmium Court, is one fragment of a rocky planet that crashed into the Fundament and broke apart. All the other nearby continents — the Helium Drinkers, the Bone Plaza, the Starcutters — came from the same world.
    
    Perhaps the other races of the Fundament are migrants too.
    
    We live on the shrapnel of our homeworld, floating on an ocean deep inside a gas giant.
    
    That’s what Fundament must be. A titanic gas planet. The endless storm above us must be one layer of the atmosphere. And the sea we float on... there’s more down beneath it. So much more!
    
    You understand what this means, Sathona. The Timid Truth is a lie. We aren’t meant to be the world’s prey. We weren’t born to live and die in the dark.
    
    We have a better destiny.
    
    Tell our father, sister Sathona. This is the proof of his life’s work.
    
    With love, for your second birthday,
    Your first surviving sister,
    Aurash
    </p>
    
        <p>
    I: Predators
    
    Predators and Menaces —
    Carved to endure by Xi Ro —
    Third surviving sister of the Osmium King’s last brood —
    
    A STORMJOY. A stormjoy is a living cloud. When it passes over our continent, it lowers its feeding tentacles. On each tentacle are the BAIT STARS. Although light makes you happy, you must avoid it. You will be eaten.
    
    A stormjoy is a good way for an old person to choose death. Also, a daring knight can cut the bait stars from the tentacles. I have six!
    
    FALLING. If you fall off the edge of the continent, you will die in the ocean! This is a special hazard when our father the Osmium King uses the engines.
    
    HELIUM DRINKERS. The currents of the Fundament Ocean bring us near other continents. The Helium Court is near us now. They are of our species, but they are our enemies. Their knights raid us every day. Helium Drinkers have two legs, two arms, and three eyes, just like us. But they are bright/evil. I want to be a knight and fight them!
    
    The Helium Drinker ambassador ate ten of my sisters as tribute. This is normal. However, I resent it.
    
    MOTHERS. Mothers can fly! They live much longer than ten years. Mothers are extremely smart, and they guard their spawn. If you try to tamper with the eggs, they will eat you. Sathona wants to eat the jelly and become a mother when she turns four.
    
    STORMS. The rain is often poisonous. Sometimes it dissolves flesh. When lightning misses the lightning farm, it can vaporize a person.
    
    This entire world is deadly to us.
    
    MYSTERIES. The Fundament is very large. We are the smallest things in it. If you don’t understand something, it will probably kill you. My teacher Taox says this is why we have such short lives. So we can breed and adapt quickly.
    
    MOON WAVES. My sister Aurash is afraid of moon waves. When she gets back from her expedition to the Tungsten Monoliths, I will ask her why.
        </p> 
            <p>
    II: The Hateful Verse
    
    For the consideration of the Helium Court,
    Written in desperation,
    This sealed secret,
    
    I am Taox, sterile mother, teacher to the children of the Osmium Throne.
    
    As a mother, I live long. As a neuter, I can rise above the small battles of court politics.
    
    I alone see the patterns of survival. Alone I designed the great engines that move the Osmium Court. Now —
    
    Alone I must act to save my kingdom.
    
    Senility has claimed my lord the Osmium King. He is ten, and mad. The study of ancient text consumes him. Today he raves about moons above the storm. Tomorrow he will wander the halls, speaking to his familiar, a dead white worm from the deep sea. He keeps it in glass, and he tends to it, and he neglects the duties of a king.
    
    The Osmium King has three surviving heirs, each two years old:
    
    Xi Ro, the youngest and bravest, who wants to be a knight.
    
    Sathona, most clever, who wants to be a mother.
    
    Aurash, navigator child, who dreams of the infinite ocean. Tomorrow she will return from the Tungsten Monoliths.
    
    None of these are suitable heirs. None of them will protect the Osmium Court from the howling Fundament. Xi Ro can fight, but not lead. Sathona can think, but not fight. Aurash’s curiosity will draw her away from duty. I fear for all future children.
    
    Soon the Osmium King will lock himself into the Royal Orrery to study the moons. Gather your knights, o Helium Drinkers, and invade our continent. Kill the three heirs. I will rule the Osmium Court as your regent, and build engines for you.
    
    And if I fail, let the Leviathan in the deep eat me.
    
    Written in grief,
    This hateful request,
    Taox, Osmium-mother, neutered to watch
            </p>
    
                <p>
    III: The Oath
    
    
    Sisters! This is how an oath is done. Put your left hands on the mast, close to mine.
    
    Take the knife in your right hand. Push it through your left hand, straight between the bones. Now! Carve a blood line down the mast.
    
    Speak your oath.
    
    “I am Xi Ro, youngest daughter of the dead king. I will take back my Osmium Court and kill the traitor Taox. On my left eye I swear vengeance.”
    
    In blood the oath is made.
    
    “I am Sathona, middle daughter of the dead king. I will take back my home and eat the mother jelly. I will raise my spawn on the corpse of the Helium King. On my right eye I promise this.”
    
    In blood the oath is made.
    
    Now...
    
    “I will help make your oath, sister.”
    
    “I will help it too.”
    
    I am Aurash, first daughter of the dead king. I will chase my father’s last screamed warning. I will know what changed the motion of our moons. If the end of the world is coming, I will understand why.
    
    On my center eye I swear it. I will understand.
    
    “In blood the oath is made.”
    
    “In blood.”
    
    Thank you, sisters. We have only my ship left to us. But a ship is freedom! We have secrets to hunt, storm-lit realms to explore, and great armies to raise.
    
    Put up the lightning sails, and we will voyage far.
                </p>
    
    
      <p>
    IV: Syzygy
    
    The Syzygy —
    Carved to endure by Aurash —
    The high vengeance —
    
    Only Xi Ro’s bait stars let us escape. Only Sathona’s tricks let us reach the coast. But now that we have my ship, I must lead the way. I am the navigator.
    
    We may never see our homes again. Xi Ro seethes with hate and fury for Taox.
    
    But this is my deepest fear —
    
    Our civilization drifts on the Fundament. At the Tungsten Monoliths I learned that thousands of other species drift with us, coexisting on a vast world sea. And the tides of the Fundament move us all.
    
    The Timid Truth says that we are the smallest, most fragile things alive. The natural prey of the universe. Taox would have us believe that our ancestors came to the Fundament to hide from the hungry void.
    
    My father died afraid. Not of vile Taox or the Helium Drinkers, but of his orrery. He screamed to me —
    
    “Aurash, my first daughter! The moons are different! The laws are bent!”
    
    And he made the sign of a syzygy.
    
    Imagine the fifty-two moons of Fundament lining up in the sky. (It wouldn’t take all fifty-two, of course: just a few massive moons. But this is my deepest fear.) Imagine their gravity pulling on the Fundament sea, lifting it into a swollen bulge...
    
    Imagine that bulge collapsing as the syzygy passed. A wave big enough to swallow civilizations. A God-Wave.
    
    I have to find a way to stop it. Before the God-Wave annihilates my species. If I could only get back into my father’s orrery, I could learn exactly when!
    
    We are weeks of travel and many continents away from home.
    
    When I’m paralyzed by fear, Xi Ro sits in the cabin with me and comforts me with soft, brave words. But more and more we have come to rely on Sathona’s wit. She will go off to be alone (she insists she must be alone) and return with some mad idea — steer into the storm, throw down a net, eat that strange beast, explore that menacing wreck.
    
    Somehow Sathona seems to manufacture good luck by sheer will.

    V: Needle and Worm
    
    My secrets —
    Carved in my code by Sathona —
    The right eye vengeance —
    
    1. This year of wild voyaging, these lightning nights and golden days, these forays into ancient wrecks and windblown flights from monsters: these are the happiest times of my life.
    
    2. I want to be a mother not because I want to spawn but because I want a long life. Long enough to make a difference. We have been at sea a year and I am afraid, afraid we will die out here.
    
    3. I know where to find secrets. I know where vast slow things with long memories live.
    
    4. The needle ship...
    
    The needle ship —
    Carved in my code by Sathona —
    A liar —
    
    1. We salvaged the needle from the Shvubi Maelstrom. I knew it would be there.
    
    2. The needle is a gray ship, as long and slender as hope, as unbreakable as time, and old. Older than death. It tumbled through the maelstrom before our ancestors crashed into the Fundament. This is not a sea-ship, like Aurash’s. It is an artifact of high technology.
    
    3. I know its purpose. I know what happened to the crew.
    
    4. Xi Ro wants to sell the ship at Kaharn Atoll, where species gather. At auction, it would earn us enough wealth to hire mercenaries. We could retake our Osmium Court and send the baby-eating Helium Drinkers screaming into the ocean —
    
    5. — but I told Xi Ro the ship was worthless.
    
    6. Aurash wants to open the ship and see if we can take command of it. I know this is the right thing to do. I know because I asked the worm...
    
    The worm —
    Carved in my code by Sathona —
    Who should be afraid —
    
    1. It was my father’s familiar. I ripped it from him as we fled. It is a dead white thing, segmented, washed up from the deep sea.
    
    2. It’s dead, but it still speaks to me. It says: listen closely, oh vengeance mine...

    VI: Sisters
    
    Aregister of tokens and gestures exchanged before the end of sisterhood.
    
    “Xi Ro, my brave sister, you have worked too hard to move the carcasses out of the birthing room! Come. Steer the ship for a while. Take joy in what our needle can do.”
    
    Xi Ro tried to protest, but secretly, she was so glad for Aurash’s care. She flew the needle ship in cutting circles, down beneath the sea: and their wake rose up to the surface like a traitor’s dying breath.
    
    “Aurash, lonely navigator, we have traveled so long with only each other. I know you love to hear and speak new tongues. Come, sit in the flesh garden room. I will read you these stories I bought at Kaharn.”
    
    Aurash sat among the mummified flesh fans with two of her eyes closed and listened in silence to Sathona’s stories, hungry to understand, voracious to know as much as she could before her ten year life died.
    
    Later, Xi Ro said, “Sathona, cutting mind of ours, you grow lonely in your thought. Play swords and lanterns with me!”
    
    But Sathona was heavy with sorrow, and couldn’t pretend any joy as she chased Xi Ro through the needle’s glistening halls.
    
    “Sathona, pensive one, what is it? What troubles you?”
    
    Her sisters listened as Sathona said “Oath-bearing siblings, we are five years old. For two years we’ve worked to repair this ancient ship and understand its systems. I am almost too old for the mother jelly, and the knights who killed our father are surely dying of age.
    
    “We three will die here, in exile. Taox will outlive us. And Aurash, brilliant-eyed Aurash, you will die of old age long before you have proof of your God-Wave, or any way to stop it.”
    
    Aurash and Xi Ro looked at each other. “I wish you weren’t so honest,” Xi Ro said. And Aurash thought that Sathona had never been wrong.
    
    In her soul Aurash knew that the only way to keep their oath was to find a great, powerful secret. A secret that could change everything. This was Aurash’s soul, her fire and her shadow — her desire to cut through the flank of the world and find its beating heart.
    
    “We have to dive,” Aurash said. “That’s what this ship is built to do. Dive into the Fundament, the world below us... towards the core.”
    
    “That’s where the ancient crew died so obscenely,” Xi Ro protested. “That’s where the atrocity in the birthing room was born...”
    
    “We have to dive,” Sathona said, following the whispers of her familiar. “In the world beneath us, in the metallic depths, I hope we may find what we need most...”
    
    More time. More life.
