        <h3> COMM 150 (The Art of Cinema): COMM 150 is an introduction to cinema studies which
            aims to provide students with media literacy for a world in which communication is 
            increasingly visual and cinematic in its form. The course assumes that films tell 
            stories and make arguments as communicative forms by drawing on a visual language 
            that can be learned. As such, films can be interpreted and analyzed to reveal something
            about the cultural conditions that produced them. The course seeks to familiarize 
            students with examples of films that speak to both the forms that they follow and the 
            cultural context in which they were produced. Movies, from early silent films to contemporary
            blockbusters, are examined as formal constructs, market commodities, and cultural artifacts 
            that aim to represent a world for the viewer. Topics include the emergence of the cinema as a 
            communications technology, business industry and cultural institution; the global dominance 
            of classical Hollywood cinema; American film industry organization (production, distribution, 
            exhibition, vertical integration, the studio system, the star system); analysis of film styles 
            national cinemas, historical movements); analysis of film genres (e.g., silent film melodrama, 
            film noir, comedy, the war film, the western); consideration of film audiences (reception, spectatorship, 
            criticism); introduction to film aesthetics (film art and appreciation); and alternative cinemas (independent, 
            documentary and experimental cinemas). COMM 150 emphasizes media literacy and seeks to help students 
            develop critical thinking, reading and viewing skills while providing them with a historical context 
            for the media that they consume on a regular basis. All sections integrate lectures and readings with 
            viewing feature films during the weekly practicum period. Many sections also incorporate slides and 
            film or video clips during the lecture periods to allow students to exercise their critical viewing 
            skills regarding certain teaching points. Students prepare for film screenings by reading, listening 
            to lectures, and analyzing examples of relevant works. Introductory lectures seek to provide a critical 
            and historical context for each week's screening; follow-up lectures offer critical analysis and examinations 
            reward close viewing. The core purpose of the course, therefore, is to make film viewing a conscious, critical and analytic activity.
