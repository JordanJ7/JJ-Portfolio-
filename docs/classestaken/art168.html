        <h3> ART 168 The Digital Medium (3) This course will provide a much needed introductory technological/digital 
            component wherein computing will be discussed as a media, rather than a tool. Students will be engaged in 
            the creation of artistic manifestations of individual interpretations surrounding themes and concepts 
            introduced in class. Each unit of the course will build upon the next resulting in a knowledge base of the 
            possibilities of what the digital medium includes. Students will be asked to demonstrate their knowledge 
            of the medium with a culminating final project that uses at least four of the techniques demonstrated in class. 
            The final project will be determined by the student, manifestations may include a web site, short film, installation, projects, or performance.
