        <h3> Mass communications in the United States: organization, role, content, and effects of newspapers,
            magazines, television, radio, books, and films. The Mass Media and Society is an overview of the 
            interaction between mass media and society. By drawing from selected topics, the course pays particular 
            attention to the social influences (e.g., economics, politics, technology, law and culture) that shape media messages. 
            Among others, the course examines the nature of media controllers as well as the character of users and consumers of media products. 
            By so doing, students are informed about the overall structure and scope of the mass media and led to understand the 
            power and influences associated with media messages and practices. By the end of the semester, each student should have 
            a better understanding of the dynamic nature of the mass media in an information society.
