        <h3> ART 20 is intended as a general survey of the art of drawing for non-majors. As a studio offering, 
            emphasis is placed on hands-on studio activities, which promote visual literacy and on the various 
            conventions used in drawing. Students will be given the opportunity to briefly explore many of the 
            traditional materials of drawing, including pencil, charcoal, conte, ink and ink wash, pastel, as well 
            as experimental tools. Slide presentations, studio visits and museum critiques will augment studio 
            exercises to facilitate a greater awareness of the cultural context in which drawing functions. As a 
            general appreciation offering, emphasis is placed on active learning processes that involve students in 
            basic studio materials and techniques. Since the School of Visual Arts now requires a portfolio review 
            for Visual Arts majors to enroll in studio courses, ART 20 provides an opportunity for non-art majors to 
            do studio work in conjunction with an exploration of art concepts.
