        <h3> A team of students manages the production of a game from concept to implementation.
            
            GAME 480 Game Development Project (3) In this course students take the entire semester to creating a 
            game that will be published. Students are assembled into teams and will be expected to create a game 
            from conception to publication in a very short period of time. What will result from the completion of 
            this course is a demonstration of the knowledge accumulated in previous GAME courses and in important 
            components of your portfolio to enable you to obtain a job in the industry.
