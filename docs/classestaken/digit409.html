        <h3> tudents will develop 3d digital creation skills in relation to their field(s) of study.
            
            DIGIT 409: Advanced Digital Creations is a problem-based learning class that uses the digital media 
            concepts and tools introduced in Art 168 to develop an in-depth understanding of 3d digital art. 
            They will enhance their creative and philosophical sensibilities in the technology, software, and 
            media relevant to the field (s) of study they are pursuing.Through a series of learning problems, 
            students will synthesize advanced skills and knowledge needed to accomplish techniques used in the 
            creation of digital 3d imagery. They will integrate 3d sculpting, modeling, animation, and/or painting 
            practices with computer-based image processing for creative, and professionally oriented results. 
            They will develop critical and conceptual sensibilities needed to discuss and evaluate their work and the work of others using these methods.
            Students will identify, research, and analyze effective professional and creative practices in the 
            field of digital creativity with emphasis on developing skillful digital processing techniques. 
            These practices include creating mockups of concepts, art-making practices for enhanced digital workflow, 
            and choosing the 3d processing techniques most appropriate for the end-use of the work.
            
            The digital medium has a relatively short history, however, as the advancement of digital technology 
            continues these techniques have entered the popular mainstream. This shift has raised challenges in 
            graphic-reliant fields such as the arts, engineering, advertising, simulation, and gaming. This course 
            will give students of these fields the opportunity to develop their artistic skills further than possible 
            in Art 168. Students will analyze and assess the factors related to their fields in in order to make sound design decisions.
