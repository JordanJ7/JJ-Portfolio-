        <h3> Waves, physics of sound, hearing, musical scales, musical instruments, and room acoustics. 
            INART 50Z The Science of Music explores 
            the physical and acoustical bases of sound and music. The physics include a study of vibrating systems 
            and simple harmonic motion, wave propagation, reflection and refraction, superposition, resonant frequencies, 
            harmonics, phase, the relationship of speed and velocity, and spectra. The acoustics portion applies these physical
            properties to hearing, sound and music, covering the nature of the human auditory system, and correlations of 
            pitch to frequency, loudness to amplitude/power/intensity, timbre to spectra and envelope. An overview of perceptual 
            psychological studies of Gestalt organizational principles and auditory streaming explores how the auditory system 
            organizes sound on a primitive, unlearned level.
            With physical and physiological groundwork laid, the subject matter moves to purely musical areas: the construction of musical scales, 
            the nature of consonance, dissonance, and harmony. Twelve-tone equal temperament, the basis of Western common practice music, is not an absolute, 
            but a decision made to facilitate certain musical choices, and a compromise in terms of optimal consonance. The nature of the different 
            instruments is then discussed - strings, winds, brass, percussion, and voice. Different instruments naturally produce different scale
            types and different types of spectra. Students will learn to appreciate the inherent differences in different instrument types.
            The course then returns to acoustics, exploring the role that performance spaces play in the propagation and reception of sound. 
            The shape and materials of a room determine its characteristic sound. Students learn about how sound in large auditoriums is characterized 
            by the balance of direct and reflected sound, the distinction between specular and diffuse reflections, the absorptive properties of different 
            building materials, and the nature of reverberation. Smaller performance spaces are subject to standing waves, flutter echo, and comb filtering. 
            Taking steps to avoid undesirable characteristics is often an easy matter once the nature of these characteristics is understood. 
            The final weeks cover audio technology and the distinctions between analog and digital formats. The course ends with a unit on auditory 
            display and sonification, wherein scientific data may be presented through musical sound.
