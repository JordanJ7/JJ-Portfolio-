On Board <ship>La Touraine</ship>,

<Date>June 30th, 1917.</Date>

Even now that we are out of sight of land, it seems impossible that I am actually off to <place><country>France</country></place>
and, for the first time in my life, traveling alone. Everything has happened so quickly since the 
<cult>American</cult> Fund for <cult>French</cult> Wounded found an opening for me in <city><place>Paris</place></city> that I suppose I am still somewhat 
dazed and bewildered. The fact that I don't know what it will all be like and that I can't look ahead 
makes it easier to be happy and live in the present. Of course I have had a bit of a taste in <place><city> New York</city> </place>
of the work that the <abrev>A. F. F. W.</abrev> is doing but its <place>Headquarters</place> in <place><city>Paris</city></place> will be different in some ways I fancy.

I can't get over how lucky I am to have this chance for I realize how few <person>girls</person> of my <time>age</time>
are getting across, and I understood the grit and pluck which made you encourage me on my great 
adventure and send me along a path which has proved so dangerous of late.

As we drifted down the <place>river</place>, in the sunset glow with two absurd <vehicle>tugs</vehicle> <action>puffing</action> alongside, 
I know that many eyes were moist and that the same thought was in all our minds. How many 
of this <vehicle>ship's</vehicle> company will see that sky-line again! It was very quiet, no one spoke much, 
and, little by little, the glow <action>faded</action> from the sky and one star after another <action>appeared</action>. 
I knew that you would be looking at those same stars down in <place>Lakewood</place> and that your thoughts
and prayers were the same that filled my heart at that moment. Somehow distance does not separate, 
after all.

We waited near the <monument>Statue of Liberty</monument> until <time>midnight</time>—a rumor had it that a "personage" was 
to come on board. This individual was shrouded in mystery until we put to <place>sea</place> when it was given out 
that the party which had <action>clambered</action> aboard in the night was none other than the <cult>Italian</cult> Mission. 
Our spirits rose at once for, what with <person>Frank Sayre</person> on the <vehicle>boat</vehicle> and these distinguished <cult>Italian</cult> gentlemen, 
we shall doubtless be honored by a bigger convoy and so doubly safe. However, thus far we have but two 
destroyers <action>following</action> us. They can be seen distinctly outlined against the horizon, 
one on each side, and seem to be the same somber <color>gray</color> which all <vehicle>ships</vehicle> are <action>affecting</action> in this war. 
A <person>sailor</person> informed me this morning that we weren't in much danger for the first four or five days 
but that after that I might see some excitement. Here's hoping!

I have a small inside <place>cabin</place> and my <person>room-mate</person> is quite a character. She is a native of 
<place><country>Haiti</country></place>, voluble and very portly—has four large pieces of baggage in our tiny stateroom, 
wears a costume which resembles a <person>Mother Hubbard</person> and <action>smokes</action> countless thin cigarettes that 
<action>smell</action> like incense! When I appeared, there didn't seem to be much room for me but, as she says, 
luckily I am small, and I was soon <action>tucked</action> into the upper berth with my belongings! She really 
isn't bad and after <action>looking</action> me over <action>carefully</action> told me that she didn't think we would fight and 
from that time has <action>beamed</action> upon me! She is <action>going</action> over to join her <person>son</person> who has been fighting with the 
<cult>French</cult> since the beginning of the war but will never <action>go</action> back to the Front now, having lost some 
fingers off each hand. She is so thankful, she says, that he hasn't <action>lost</action> more than his fingers.
