            <p><mention ref="AE">Amelia Earhart</mention>'s last calls for help were heard by
                several people around the globe, an analysis of distress calls made following her
                disappearance reveals.</p>

            <p>The newest findings strengthen the theory that Earhart and her navigator <mention
                    ref="FN">Fred Noonan</mention> died stranded on a small uninhabited island in
                the Pacific Ocean.</p>

            <p>It runs counter to the statement made by the <mention ref="USN">U.S. Navy</mention> that the two died
                when Earhart's <mention ref="LE">Lockheed Electra</mention> fell into the ocean and
                sank to the bottom of the sea.</p>
        </intro>

        <section>
            <subtitle>Distress Calls Sent By Earhart</subtitle>

            <p><timelapse dur="P80Y">More than 80 years after</timelapse> Earhart set out on the
                    <date when="1937">summer of 1937</date> to become the first woman to
                circumnavigate the globe, researchers analyzing a collection of radio distress
                signals have found that the pilot was sending haunting pleas for help for five days
                after her plane disappeared from radars.</p>

            <p>In a paper published by researchers at <mention ref="IGHAR">The International Group
                    for Historic Aircraft Recovery</mention>, experts say they found 57 credible
                radio signals out of 120 gathered from government and private radio operators.</p>

            <p>The signals carried several messages believed to have been made by <mention ref="AE"
                    >Earhart</mention> and, at times, <mention ref="FN">Noonan</mention>. <mention
                    ref="RG">Ric Gillespie</mention>, director of <mention ref="IGHAR"
                    >TIGHAR</mention>, says Earhart may have been injured but Noonan was worse
                off.</p>

            <p>The messages provide resounding proof for <mention ref="IGHAR">TIGHAR</mention>'s
                theory that Earhart was stranded on <place>Gardner Island, now Nikumaroro</place>, a
                then-uninhabited island 2,600 miles off the coast of <place>New Zealand</place>.</p>

            <p>They also paint a chilling picture of <mention ref="AE">Earhart</mention>'s last days
                marooned on an island, venturing out into the land for shelter during the day and
                going back into the plane when the tide was low to send distress calls.</p>

            <p>"These active versus silent periods and the fact that the message changes on <date
                    when="1937-07-05">July 5</date> and starts being worried about water and then is
                consistently worried about water after that — there's a story there," <mention
                    ref="RG">Gillespie</mention> tells <mention ref="WP">The Washington Post</mention>.</p>

            <subtitle>Messages Heard Around The World</subtitle>

            <p>When <mention ref="LE">Earhart's Electra</mention> disappeared on <date
                    when="1937-07-02">July 2, 1937</date>, naval authorities requested the public to
                listen to <radioFreq>3105 and 6210 kilohertz</radioFreq>, the frequencies Earhart
                was using on the plane.</p>

            <p>However, there was a problem. Earhart's radio could only send messages to within a
                few hundred miles, which means those who were on her frequency only heard a carrier
                wave but no message.</p>

            <p>So how were military personnel and casual listeners at home able to pick up messages
                sent by her? <mention ref="RG">Gillespie</mention> explains that the pilot's
                transmitter sent out high harmonic frequencies. These wavelengths bounce off the
                Earth's ionosphere and can travel over great distances.</p>

            <p>The downside, however, is that there is no guarantee that they can send clear
                messages. Those who heard Earhart's distress calls just so happened to turn on the
                radio at the right time.</p>

            <subtitle>What Happened To Amelia Earhart?</subtitle>

            <p>The analysis creates the most detailed chronology of events that happened after
                    <mention ref="LE">Earhart's plane</mention> crashed.</p>

            <p>On July 2, just hours after the crash, professional operators heading the search
                heard a voice they thought was <mention ref="AE">Earhart</mention>'s. When they
                asked her to respond with dashes to confirm her identity, the response was picked up
                by three stations, one of which heard the word <message>"Earhart"</message>.</p>

            <p>On the second call made on the night of the same day, a housewife from Amarillo,
                Texas, heard that they were "down on an uncharted island — small, uninhabited." She
                also heard that <mention ref="FN">Noonan</mention> was injured and needed medical
                help right away.</p>

            <p>Another woman from <place>Ashland, Kentucky</place>, also heard that they were
                    <message>"down in ocean"</message> and <message>"on or near a little
                    island"</message> on the same night. She also heard mentions of a storm, blowing
                winds, and that the plane was running out of gas. <message>"Will have to get out of
                    here. We can't stay here long"</message> was what she heard.</p>
            <p> On <date when="1937-07-03">July 3</date>, operators heard a male voice, suggesting
                that <mention ref="FN">Noonan</mention> was rational. The next day, a boy from
                Wyoming heard that ship was on a reef. A station on Howland Island in the Pacific
                heard a woman's voice saying <message>"tell husband all right"</message>, also on
                    <date when="1937-07-04">July 4</date>.</p>

            <p>On <date when="1937-07-05">July 5</date>, a <place>U.S. Navy station in
                    Hawaii</place> received the Morse Code <message type="morseCode">"281 North
                    Howland Call KHAQQ Beyond North Don't Hold With Us Much Longer Above Water Shut
                    Off"</message>.</p>
            <p> On the same day, a girl from <place>St. Petersburg, Florida</place>, heard <mention
                    ref="AE">Earhart</mention> and <mention ref="FN">Noonan</mention> calling for
                help. Noonan had clearly become irrational, as he was heard yelling and complaining
                about his head. Earhart was heard saying that <mention ref="LE">the plane</mention>
                was starting to slip off the reef.</p>

            <p>The last messages were sent in the wee hours of <date when="1937-07-07">July 7,
                    1937</date>. A listener from <place>St. Johns, New Brunswick</place>, heard the
                following: <message>"Can you read me? Can you read me? This is Amelia Earhart. This
                    is Amelia Earhart. Please come in."</message></p>

            <p><mention ref="AE">Earhart</mention> mentioned her coordinates, but the listener later
                lost them. The pilot also said that <mention ref="FN">Noonan</mention> was badly
                hurt and they could not hold on much longer. Almost all of the messages were traced
                to <place>Gardner Island</place>.</p>

            <p>By <date when="1937-07-08">six o'clock the following morning</date>, the researchers
                believe the water had infiltrated the cabin. On <date when="1937-07-09">July
                    9</date>, <mention ref="USN">U.S. Navy planes</mention> scoured the area above
                    <place>Gardner Island</place> but found no signs of a plane crash. <mention
                    ref="RG">Gillespie</mention> says the plane sank to the seabed sometime between
                the last distress call on <date from="1937-07-07" to="1937-07-09">July 7 and July
                    9</date>.</p>

            <p>In <date when="1940">1940</date>, skeletons were unearthed on <place>Gardner
                    Island</place>, providing perhaps the most solid piece of evidence that <mention
                    ref="AE">Earhart</mention> died a castaway. <mention ref="RJ">Richard
                    Jantz</mention>, an expert in skeletal biology at the <mention ref="UT"
                    >University of Tennessee</mention>, analyzed one of the skeletons and believes
                it is Earhart's.</p>
